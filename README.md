# Comparison (Malaysia)

http://comparison.zynick.com

Looking for something online?

Compare multiple online stores and find the cheapest item in Malaysia!

## What is this site for?

As chinese saying goes "Shop and compare items among 3 stores before making a purchase". Instead of visiting all the online stores, Comparison gather all of them and show the cheapest item to you. 

Saves time and energy, all in one place.

## Where do you get all your sources?

The list of local (Malaysia) online stores are:
 * Easy http://www.easy.my
 * Ebay http://www.ebay.com.my
 * Expansys http://www.expansys.my
 * IPMart http://www.ipmart.com.my
 * Lazada http://www.lazada.com.my
 * Lelong http://www.lelong.com.my
 * MobileMegamall http://mobilemegamall.com
 * Qoo10 http://qoo10.my
 * Rakuten http://www.rakuten.com.my
 * Retrons http://www.retrons.com
 * SengHeng http://www.senheng.com.my
 * Shashinki http://shashinki.com
 * Superbuy http://www.superbuy.my
 * YouBeli http://www.youbeli.com
 * Zalora http://www.zalora.com.my

## Why the result isn't really compelling?

Comparison did the search using search engine available at each of the local online stores, where the result is dependent on what is returned based on their own search engine. 

If any of them return non-related item based on the keyword user search for, Comparison will still collect and display as intended.

## Why my online store isn't listed?

It's easy to add your site onto Comparison. Fork this repo and add your code in com.zynick.comparison package, and I'll merge your code onto the site.

## How does this work?

Comparison uses Web Scraping (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) technique to crawl over local online sites, gather all result and sort them by price, allowing the cheapest item to be listed on top among others.

## What kind of technology is used?

Bootstrap + Javascript (JQuery) as Front End, and Java Servlet as Back End.
